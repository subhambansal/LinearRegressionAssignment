## General Information
> Business Problem:
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

> The company wants to know:

- Drive the varible which define the target varibale count.

> Solution Stratgy: 
Divided analysis in below mentioned border catogry

### The steps to be followed in this exercise are as follows:
##### Loading, understanding and visualizing the data check for missing and unique values pool
##### creating the data for model training (derving feature attributes for X axis,train-test split, rescaling)
##### Fit the line for data and Train the model
##### Residual analysis and other type of analysis for understanding
##### Run model with Test set , Prediction and evaluation of the test set


## Conclusions
- R_Squ of 0.83 on training dataset
- R_Squ ared of 0.81 on test dataset

## Technologies Used
-  Jupyter notebook as IDE for pyton 3 
-  library - Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,seaborn,plotly,statsmodels and sklearn
